       "'This paper presents a novel model for text summarization that utilizes a structured self-attentive mechanism. The model is trained end-to-end and can generate both single-document and multi-document summaries. The proposed model outperforms several baseline models on two widely used datasets, DUC 2003 and CNN/Daily Mail, in terms of ROUGE scores.\\n\\nThe paper compares the proposed model with several baselines, including reference summaries, grammaticality, co-occurrence, and semantic similarity measures. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over these baseline models.\\n\\nThe paper highlights the importance of attention mechanisms in text summarization and provides a comprehensive analysis of various attention mechanisms used in previous works. It also discusses the challenges associated with training end-to-end summarization models and proposes solutions to overcome them.'"
