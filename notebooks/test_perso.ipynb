The author also mentions their use of K-Means clustering algorithm to preserve semantic diversity and their implementation of the TextRank algorithm for extractive summarization. Additionally, they mention using pre-trained language models such as Llama and comparing the BERTScore between samples generated by the model and a double-checker. The author also mentions that time is an important factor in their specific use case and that TextRank is a more suitable choice for long source texts.'"
