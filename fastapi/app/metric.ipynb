       "'It\\'s official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It\\'s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama\\'s full remarks . Syrian crisis: Latest developments . U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama\\'s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. \"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there\\'s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team\\'s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. \"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama: \\'This menace must be confronted\\' Obama\\'s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president\\'s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament\\'s vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama\\'s hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria\\'s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria . Obama decision came Friday night . On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It\\'s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. \"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said. Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria . Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Reactions mixed to Obama\\'s speech . A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama\\'s announcement. \"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\" Some members of Congress applauded Obama\\'s decision. House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama\\'s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama\\'s speech in a Twitter post Saturday. \"I understand and support Barack Obama\\'s position on Syria,\" Cameron said. An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory. \"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post. In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday. \"Like many other Americans...we\\'re just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration. What do Syria\\'s neighbors think? Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad . Syria\\'s government unfazed . After Obama\\'s speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels. Syria\\'s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling. \"The Syrian Army\\'s status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama\\'s address. An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\" A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States. \"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria\\'s ambassador to the United Nations. Both Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don\\'t know how to get down.\" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark \\'disaster\\' Opinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea .'"

       "'It\\'s official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It\\'s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama\\'s full remarks . Syrian crisis: Latest developments . U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama\\'s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. \"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there\\'s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team\\'s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. \"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama: \\'This menace must be confronted\\' Obama\\'s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president\\'s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament\\'s vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama\\'s hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria\\'s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria . Obama decision came Friday night . On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It\\'s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. \"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said. Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria . Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Reactions mixed to Obama\\'s speech . A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama\\'s announcement. \"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\" Some members of Congress applauded Obama\\'s decision. House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama\\'s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama\\'s speech in a Twitter post Saturday. \"I understand and support Barack Obama\\'s position on Syria,\" Cameron said. An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory. \"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post. In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday. \"Like many other Americans...we\\'re just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration. What do Syria\\'s neighbors think? Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad . Syria\\'s government unfazed . After Obama\\'s speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels. Syria\\'s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling. \"The Syrian Army\\'s status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama\\'s address. An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\" A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States. \"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria\\'s ambassador to the United Nations. Both Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don\\'t know how to get down.\" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark \\'disaster\\' Opinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea .'"

       "'Page: Albert Camus\\nSummary: Albert Camus ( kam-OO; French: [albɛʁ kamy] ; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, dramatist, journalist, world federalist, and political activist. He was the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel.\\nCamus was born in Algeria during the French colonization, to pied-noir parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the University of Algiers. He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at Combat, an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union because of their totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that was rejected by most parties.\\nPhilosophically, Camus\\' views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. Some consider Camus\\' work to show him to be an existentialist, even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\\n\\nPage: The Stranger (Camus novel)\\nSummary: The Stranger (French: L\\'Étranger [letʁɑ̃ʒe], lit.\\u2009\\'The Foreigner\\'), also published in English as The Outsider, is a 1942 novella written by French author Albert Camus. The first of Camus\\'s novels published in his lifetime, the story follows Meursault, an indifferent settler in French Algeria, who, weeks after his mother\\'s funeral, kills an unnamed Arab man in Algiers. The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault\\'s first-person narrative before and after the killing.  \\nCamus completed the initial manuscript by May 1941, with revisions suggested by André Malraux, Jean Paulhan, and Raymond Queneau that were adopted in the final version. The original French-language first edition of the novella was published on 19 May 1942, by Gallimard, under its original title; it appeared in bookstores from that June but was restricted to an initial 4,400 copies, so few that it could not be a bestseller. Published during the Nazi occupation of France, it went on sale without censorship or omission by the Propaganda-Staffel.\\nIt began being published in English from 1946, first in the United Kingdom, where its title was changed to avoid confusion with the translation of Maria Kuncewiczowa\\'s novel of the same name; after being published in the United States, the novella retained its original name, and the British-American difference in titles has persisted in subsequent editions. The Stranger gained popularity among anti-Nazi circles following its focus in Jean-Paul Sartre\\'s 1947 article \"Explication de L\\'Étranger\" (\"Analysis of The Stranger\").\\nConsidered a classic of 20th-century literature, The Stranger has received critical acclaim for Camus\\'s philosophical outlook, absurdism, syntactic structure, and existentialism (despite Camus\\'s rejection of the label), particularly within its final chapter. Le Monde ranked The Stranger as number one on its 100 Books of the 20th Century. The novella has twice been adapted for film: Lo Straniero (1967) and Yazgı (2001), has seen numerous references and homages in television and music (notably \"Killing an Arab\" by The Cure), and was retold from the perspective of the unnamed Arab man’s brother in Kamel Daoud\\'s 2013 novel The Meursault Investigation.\\n\\nPage: Amor fati\\nSummary: Amor fati is a Latin phrase that may be translated as \"love of fate\" or \"love of one\\'s fate\". It is used to describe a'"

       "'Ada est un langage de programmation orienté objet dont les premières versions remontent au début des années 1980.\\n\\nPrésentation \\nAda est un langage de programmation conçu par l’équipe de CII-Honeywell Bull dirigée par Jean Ichbiah en réponse à un cahier des charges établi par le département de la Défense des États-Unis (DoD). Les premiers travaux autour du projet ont commencé à la fin des années 1970 et dès 1979 un preliminary ADA reference manual est publié dans la revue du Special Interest Group on Programming Languages de l\\'ACM. La première version validée du projet sort au début des années 1980  sous le nom d\\'Ada 83.\\n\\nPour développer le langage, l\\'équipe de Jean Ichbiah s\\'est inspirée de son précédent langage LIS (Langage d\\'Implémentation de Systèmes), conçu à la CII pour permettre le développement de systèmes d\\'exploitation portables (à 95 %, disait Ichbiah).\\n\\nAda 83 a été ensuite repris et amélioré au milieu des années 1990 pour donner Ada 95, le second langage objet normalisé de manière internationale (publié en , il est précédé de peu par Common Lisp, publié en ). Sous les auspices de l’Organisation internationale de normalisation (ISO), le langage a bénéficié d\\'un amendement (Ada 2005) puis d\\'une nouvelle révision appelée Ada 2012.\\n\\nLe nom « Ada » a été choisi en l’honneur d’Ada Lovelace, sans doute la première informaticienne de l’histoire. Il est associé à la couleur verte car, lors de l’appel d’offres du DoD, les différentes propositions étaient désignées par des couleurs pour éviter tout biais, et l’équipe qui l’a conçu était l’équipe verte.\\n\\nVoici quelques particularités d’Ada :\\n typage statique ;\\n module par les paquetages et contrôle fin de la visibilité ;\\n syntaxe claire et non ambiguë (inspirée de celle du langage Pascal) ;\\n généricité ;\\n programmation par contrat ;\\n multi-tâche ;\\n traits temps réel intégrés au langage (tâches, objets protégés, interruptions) ;\\n bibliothèques normalisées ;\\n liens avec les autres langages ;\\n annexes temps réel avec le Profil Ravenscar pour les systèmes sûrs ;\\n le document de la norme ISO est librement téléchargeable (voir ci-dessous).\\n\\nIl est souvent utilisé dans des systèmes temps réel et embarqués nécessitant un haut niveau de fiabilité et de sécurité. De nos jours, Ada est employé bien sûr par son initiateur, mais aussi dans toutes les techniques de pointe : en France, l’automobile, les transports ferroviaires (Alstom, Siemens Mobility, Ansaldo STS), les technologies aéronautiques (Thales Land and Air Systems, Thales Avionics, Airbus, Airbus Defence and Space) et les technologies spatiales (Thales Alenia Space, ArianeGroup, CNES, Arianespace).\\n\\nEn 2013, il est possible de trouver des compilateurs Ada pour certains systèmes d’exploitation (Windows, Linux, VxWorks) et architectures matérielles, y compris un compilateur libre (GNAT, inclus dans GNU Compiler Collection) compilant de l’Ada 83/95/2005/2012.\\n\\nAda est parfois utilisé en introduction aux cours de programmation informatique avancée, et il peut être utilisé pour les cours d\\'introduction à la programmation.\\n\\nAutres langages dans la mouvance Ada \\nAda est inspiré du langage Pascal dont il a repris tant l\\'esprit de la syntaxe que de l\\'architecture. Le langage Ada a inspiré Bertrand Meyer pour la conception du langage Eiffel, qui y ajoute des notions de programmation par contrat (mais se montre moins adapté à l\\'industrie sous certains aspects). La notion de programmation par contrat, formalisée par Bertrand Meyer avec Eiffel, a amené la création d\\'une extension au langage Ada, , pour lui faire supporter des notations permettant d\\'exprimer des assertions contractuelles dans les spécifications. La programmation par contrat (des sous-programmes ou des types d\\'objets) est désormais intégrée dans la version Ada 2012.\\n\\nAda a inspiré le langage PL/SQL dans le domaine des bases de données, ainsi que le langage VHDL pour les architectures matérielles.\\n\\nLe langage Ada est également à la base de la conception des différents langages de la norme CEI 61131-3, en particulier la partie déclarative commune à tous les langages et le langage ST (texte structuré).\\n\\n\"Hello, world!\" en Ada 95 ou Ada 2005 \\nUn exemple courant pour montrer la syntaxe d’un langage est le programme Hello world :\\n\\nwith Ada.Text_IO; -- Bibliothèque\\n\\n-- Déclaration de la procédure \"Hello\"\\nprocedure Hello is\\nbegin\\n  -- Imprimer \"Hello, world!\" à l\\'écran\\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(\"Hello, world!\");\\nend Hello;\\n\\nIl existe des raccourcis pour Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line nécessitant moins de caractères, mais ils ne sont pas utilisés ici pour des raisons de compréhension. Pour des explications plus détaillées, vous pouvez consulter Wikibooks:Ada Programming/Basic.\\n\\nBref historique \\n 1974 : le département de la Défense américain s\\'aperçoit qu’il gaspille énormément d’argent en utilisant grosso modo un langage de programmation par application, et en entretenant des programmes écrits dans des langages obsolètes endémiques ou exotiques. Certaines sources avancent le chiffre de  de programmation employés en ces lieux.Le résultat de cette prise de conscience est l’élaboration, en trois ans, du cahier des charges d’un langage unique, suffisamment souple et puissant pour remplacer tous les autres, que ce soit pour le guidage de missiles ou les travaux sur l’intelligence artificielle en passant par les applications de gestion.\\n 1977 : le département lance un appel d’offres, remporté par une équipe dirigée par le Français Jean Ichbiah.\\n 1980 : Jean Ichbiah fonde la compagnie Alsys ().\\n 1983 : Ada83 est normalisé aux États-Unis par l’ANSI (ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983).\\n 1987 : Ada83 fait l’objet de la norme internationale ISO 8652:1987.\\n 1990 : à partir des améliorations apportées par les différents développeurs de compilateurs, l’Ada Joint Program Office lance un projet de révision du langage.\\n 1991 : Alsys est revendu à Thomson-CSF et devient TSP (Thomson Software Products).\\n 1992 : un contrat est passé entre le comité de révision (Ada9X Program Office) et l’Université de New York pour le développement d’un compilateur de référence pour le nouveau langage, qui sera librement disponible. Ce compilateur, GNAT, est basé sur la technologie GCC de GNU.\\n 1994 : la société Ada Core Technologies (aujourd’hui AdaCore) est fondée par les membres du projet GNAT pour poursuivre la maintenance du compilateur et en assurer la commercialisation et le support.\\n 1995 : la révision tant attendue arrive à son terme, Ada95 voit le jour. Une norme révisée est publiée, ISO/CEI 8652:1995. Ada95 est le premier langage mettant en œuvre la programmation orientée objet à faire l’objet d’une norme ISO. Le compilateur GNAT couvre l’intégralité de la norme Ada95, y compris l’ensemble de ses annexes optionnelles.\\n 1996 : TSP devient Aonix.\\n 2000 : l’Ada Conformity Assessment Authority (ACAA) publie un ensemble de corrections mineures accumulées au cours des cinq années précédentes : le Technical Corrigendum 1.\\n 2003 : un rapport du  prédit la mort du langage Ada malgré sa supériorité sur les autres.\\n 2007 : l\\'ISO publie l\\'Amendement 1 au langage qui introduit de nouvelles fonctions et officialise de nombreuses améliorations proposées initialement par les différents développeurs de compilateurs. Cette version du langage porte le nom d\\'Ada 2005, année durant laquelle l\\'Amendement fut figé pour publication par l\\'ISO.\\n 2012 : l\\'ISO publie une nouvelle révision de la norme (Ada 2012), qui apporte notamment des facilités syntaxiques, la programmation par contrat, le support des architectures multi-cœurs, et une extension de la bibliothèque prédéfinie.\\n 2016 : Parution d\\'un corrigendum technique à Ada 2012\\n\\nVoir aussi\\n\\nArticles connexes \\n\\n GNAT (compilateur Ada libre)\\n MaRTE OS (système d\\'exploitation temps réel écrit en Ada)\\n\\nLiens externes \\n \\n \\n \\n  Ada Information Clearinghouse : les documents normatifs et bien d\\'autres choses encore.\\n  Ada Conformity Assessment Authority : ce groupe indépendant supervise la vérification de conformité des mises en œuvre du langage (autrefois appelé « validation ») et pilote le processus d’amendement et d’amélioration de la définition du langage.\\n Ada France : cette association organise un concours tous les ans avec des prix élevés ( pour le premier prix).\\n  Les pages libres d’AdaCore : AdaCore propose ici en téléchargement ses outils GPL notamment le compilateur GNAT et l’environnement de développement GPS.\\n Developpez : diverses ressources sur Ada.\\n un cours Ada95 complet (sauf temps réel)\\n  MIL-STD-1815A, Ada Programming Language\\n  Site d\\'information sur Ada 2012\\n\\nBibliographie \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Léa-Linux : Introduction au langage Ada.\\n Simon Descarpentries, Ada95 et GTK+, le duo gagnant ?
